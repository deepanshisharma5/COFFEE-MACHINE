# COFFEE-MACHINE
Project: Coffee Machine Simulator in Python
Welcome to the Coffee Machine Simulator, a Python-based interactive terminal program that simulates the functionality of a real-world coffee vending machine. Users can order different types of coffee, pay using virtual coins, and receive their drinks along with the correct change — all while resource levels are tracked.

🛠️ Features
✅ Offers three drink options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
💰 Accepts virtual coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies)
📉 Deducts ingredients like water, milk, and coffee based on recipes
🔁 Allows continuous ordering until the machine is turned off
🧾 Displays current resource levels via the report command
💸 Calculates and returns change if the inserted amount exceeds the cost
🚫 Rejects orders if insufficient resources or payment
